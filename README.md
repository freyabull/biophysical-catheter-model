This project provides a set of classes, methods and a program in order to simulate the bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter.
The model is broken down into 3 parts.
1. A FKPP reaction-diffusion equation is used to model the spread of bacteria up the outside of the catheter tubing.
2. The bladder is modelled as a well-mixed volume, with an influx of bacteria from the top of the outer catheter (logistic growth with dilution).
3. The inside of the catheter is modelled as bacteria suspended in a pressure-driven pipe flow (advection-diffusion). The adhesion of bacteria to the surface is modelled as diffusion to an absorbing surface. On the surface of the catheter the behaviour of the bacteria are again modelled by an FKPP equation, this time with a source term (the bacterial flux from the flow). A boundary layer approximation is used to estimate the bacterial flux.

## Requirements

This project has been tested on:
- WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04.3
- Linux RHEL 7.8

Makefile provided for GNU gcc compiler.

### BasicCatheter dependencies:
- C++ standard

### Data analysis dependencies:
- Python 3
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
```

### Sensitivity analysis dependencies:
- Python 3
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
SALib
```

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/freyabull/biophysical-catheter-model.git
cd biophysical-catheter-model
make
```

## Running
### BasicCatheter demo
```
cd BasicCatheter/BasicCatheter
./Catheter
```
The file `params.txt` contains the name of the file results will be written to (default: `results.csv`), followed by the simulation parameters.

### Data analysis
- The file `data_analysis/single_data.py` is an example python script for analysing the `results.csv` file generated by `BasicCatheter` to find the maximum bladder density and the time taken to attain 0.99*maximum.
- The file `data_analysis/make_figs.ipynb` contains an interactive (Jupyter) notebook. Open the file and `Run All` to generate figures from the raw data provided.

### Sensitivity analysis
The file `sensitivity_analysis/sensitivity_analysis.ipynb` contains an interactive (Jupyter) notebook. Open the file and `Run All` to generate a sensitivity analysis of the provided dataset.
